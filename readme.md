# sad2cat

convert your sad face into a cat photo

## [live site](https://dkessner.github.io/sad2cat/)

This project uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) together with the
[clmtrackr](https://www.auduno.com/clmtrackr) open source face tracking
library to detect the user's facial expression.  Random cat photos are
provided by [The Cat API - Cats as a Service](https://thecatapi.com/).

This project is meant to be a relatively minimal example of a web app
using p5.js, face tracking, and web APIs.
